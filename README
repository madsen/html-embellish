HTML::Embellish version $%v%$

HTML::Embellish adds typographical enhancements to HTML text.  It
converts certain ASCII characters to Unicode characters.  It converts
quotation marks and apostrophes into curly quotes.  It converts
hyphens into em-dashes.  It inserts non-breaking spaces between the
periods of an ellipsis.  (It doesn't use the HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS
character (U+2026), because I like more space in my ellipses.)
