HTML::Embellish
===============

HTML::Embellish is a Perl module that adds typographical enhancements
to HTML text.  It converts certain ASCII characters to Unicode
characters.  It converts quotation marks and apostrophes into curly
quotes.  It converts hyphens into em-dashes.  It inserts non-breaking
spaces between the periods of an ellipsis.  (It doesn't use the
HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS character (U+2026), because I like more space in
my ellipses.)

This is a Git repository where development of HTML::Embellish
takes place.  For more information, visit
